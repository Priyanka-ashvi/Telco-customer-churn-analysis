# Telco_Customer_Churn_Analysis
Analyzed telecom customer data to identify key factors driving churn using Python. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to uncover insights on customer behavior, payment methods, and contract types.
Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in a telecom company to identify the key factors influencing customer retention and attrition. Using Python-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, we explore how customer demographics, services, billing methods, and contract types impact churn behavior.

The analysis provides data-driven insights to help telecom providers improve retention, reduce customer loss, and enhance business profitability.

🚀 Objectives

To analyze customer churn patterns and determine the most influential factors.

To visualize relationships between churn and different service, payment, and demographic variables.

To identify actionable insights that can help reduce churn rates.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas → Data cleaning & manipulation

numpy → Numerical computations

matplotlib & seaborn → Data visualization

jupyter notebook → Interactive analysis

📂 Dataset Information

Source: Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)

Rows: 7,043

Columns: 21

Target Variable: Churn (Yes/No)

Key columns include:
gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents, tenure, PhoneService, InternetService,
OnlineSecurity, TechSupport, Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod,
MonthlyCharges, and TotalCharges.

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA focuses on uncovering hidden churn patterns and business insights through visual storytelling.

🔹 Key Analyses & Visuals:

Customer Demographics: Gender, Senior Citizen, Partner, Dependents

Service Usage: Internet Service, Tech Support, Streaming, Device Protection

Billing & Payment: Payment Method, Paperless Billing

Contract Type & Tenure: Month-to-Month, One-Year, Two-Year Contracts

Numerical Analysis: Monthly Charges, Total Charges distribution

🔹 Visualizations:

Count plots by churn status

Stacked bar charts showing churn percentages

Histograms for tenure and monthly charges

Pie charts for churn proportions

Subplots comparing billing and churn patterns

📊 Insights Summary

Overall churn rate: ~26.5%

Customers with month-to-month contracts show the highest churn (43%).

Electronic check users churn the most (≈45%) — manual payment methods are linked to higher attrition.

Paperless billing customers churn twice as much as traditional billing users.

Senior citizens and high monthly charge customers show higher churn probability.

Customers with Tech Support or Security add-ons are more loyal (churn < 20%).

💡 Business Recommendations

Offer discounts or incentives for long-term contracts.

Promote automatic payments (credit/bank) to reduce missed payments.

Introduce loyalty programs for customers with high tenure.

Target at-risk groups (paperless billing, senior citizens) with personalized offers.

📘 Project Learnings

Hands-on experience in EDA and data storytelling using Python.

Ability to derive actionable business insights from customer data.

Enhanced skills in data visualization and pattern recognition.

🏁 Conclusion

This analysis highlights how service type, billing behavior, and contract terms directly impact customer churn in the telecom industry.
By implementing data-driven retention strategies, companies can significantly reduce churn and improve customer lifetime value.
